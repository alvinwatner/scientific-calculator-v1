Specific Changes:
- Enhance equal button functionality:
  * Link calculation input parsing to equal button press
  * Process mathematical operations in correct order
  * Handle multiple operations sequentially
  * Support decimal and scientific notation results
- Add result validation:
  * Check for division by zero
  * Verify operation sequence completeness
  * Validate numeric bounds for scientific calculations
  * Handle overflow and underflow conditions

Constraints:
- Maintain scientific precision standards
- Process operations following mathematical order of operations
- Support up to 15 significant digits
- Response time under 100ms for basic operations
- Handle complex expressions with multiple operators
- Support parentheses and nested calculations

Expected Output:
When users press the equal button:
- Display accurate calculation results immediately
- Show error messages for invalid operations
- Format results appropriately (scientific notation for very large/small numbers)
- Maintain calculation history for reference
- Allow result to be used in subsequent calculations
- Properly display negative numbers and decimals
- Show computation status for longer calculations

Success Criteria:
- All basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) complete correctly
- Scientific functions (sin, cos, log, etc.) return precise results
- Complex expressions evaluate in correct order
- Error handling provides clear user feedback
- Results display properly for all number ranges
